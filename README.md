MiniMax M2.7 is a frontier LLM built for agentic execution, SOTA performance, and real-world productivity—it plans, codes, uses tools, and completes complex workflows end-to-end, then iteratively improves its own performance. It delivers state-of-the-art results on software engineering and agent benchmarks (e.g., ~56% SWE-Pro, strong performance across VIBE, Terminal Bench, and agent evaluations) while extending that same capability into office work—creating and editing high-quality Word, Excel, and PowerPoint outputs with deliverable-level accuracy . Designed for long-horizon tasks, M2.7 combines deep reasoning, tool orchestration, and reliable multi-step execution, pushing beyond static models toward systems that continuously optimize how they work across both technical and everyday productivity workflows.

## Agent Cowork

Agent Cowork is an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork — a desktop AI assistant that helps with programming, file management, and any task you can describe.

> Not just a GUI.  
> A real AI collaboration partner.  
> No need to learn the Claude Agent SDK — just create tasks and choose execution paths.



## ✨ Why Agent Cowork?

Claude Code is powerful — but it **only runs in the terminal**.

That means:
- ❌ No visual feedback for complex tasks
- ❌ Hard to track multiple sessions
- ❌ Tool outputs are inconvenient to inspect

**Agent Cowork solves these problems:**

- 🖥️ Runs as a **native desktop application**
- 🤖 Acts as your **AI collaboration partner** for any task
- 🔁 Reuses your **existing `~/.claude/settings.json`**
- No development environment or Claude Code installation required.
